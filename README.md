# Research_workspace
Source code to create a AWS virtual private cloud with research workspaces.

This sample system provides an environment that enables safe remote access to sensitive
data. It provides an example of how to enable researchers or any external agent to remotely
access compute and data resources whilst ensuring that it is difficult to copy sensitive data
out of the environment. It’s important to acknowledge that it is impossible to ever
completely prevent data theft where someone has access to that data. The default option in
this solution is acceptable in a reasonably trusted environment but can be beefed up
considerably if required
